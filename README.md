# Hotel_Booking_EDA

In recently years, City Hotel and Resort Hotel have seen high cancellation rates. Each hotel is now dealing with a number of issues as a result, including fewer revenues and less than ideal hotel room use. Consequently, lowering cancellation rates is both hotels’ primary goal in order to increase their efficiency in generating revenue, and for us to offer thorough advice to address this problem.

The analysis of hotel booking cancellation as well as other factors that have no bearing on their business and yearly revenue generation are the main topics of this project.
